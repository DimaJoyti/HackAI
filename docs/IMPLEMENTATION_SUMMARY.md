## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Interface Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing `ai.Agent` interface
- Backward compatible with current agent implementations
- Extensible for future agent types and capabilities

### Task Management
```go
type MultiAgentTask struct {
    ID                string
    Type              string
    Priority          TaskPriority
    Description       string
    RequiredAgents    []string
    OptionalAgents    []string
    Constraints       []TaskConstraint
    CollaborationMode string // "sequential", "parallel", "consensus"
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### Collaboration Modes
1. **Sequential**: `task.CollaborationMode = "sequential"`
2. **Parallel**: `task.CollaborationMode = "parallel"`
3. **Consensus**: `task.CollaborationMode = "consensus"`

### Conflict Resolution Configuration
```go
config := &OrchestratorConfig{
    ConflictResolutionMode: "consensus", // "voting", "priority", "consensus"
    ConsensusThreshold:     0.7,         // 70% agreement required
    EnableLoadBalancing:    true,
    EnableFailover:         true,
}
```
