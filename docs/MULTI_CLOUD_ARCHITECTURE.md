# HackAI Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

The HackAI platform implements a comprehensive multi-cloud infrastructure strategy that spans AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. This architecture provides high availability, disaster recovery, cost optimization, and vendor lock-in prevention while maintaining consistent security and operational standards across all cloud providers.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Cloud-Agnostic Design
- **Containerized Applications**: All services run in Kubernetes containers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules for consistent deployment
- **Declarative Configuration**: GitOps workflows for automated deployments
- **Standardized APIs**: OpenTelemetry for observability across clouds

### 2. Multi-Cloud Distribution Strategy
```
Primary Cloud: AWS (60%)
├── Production workloads
├── Core databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)
├── Primary compute resources
└── Main user traffic

Secondary Cloud: GCP (25%)

├── Data analytics and processing
├── Backup and disaster recovery
└── Development environments

Tertiary Cloud: Azure (15%)

```

### 3. Serverless-First Approach
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Serverless functions for auto-scaling
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use model for variable workloads
